HTML5 Uno Project

I like Uno. I like it a lot. So I decided to create my own version in HTML5.
The goal is to have a competitive online Uno game for 4 players, based only on HTML5 technologies.

Libraries:
Base.js - For easy OO.
p5.js - For drawing stuff
node.js - For server stuff

License:
Whatever man, does anyone ever read that? Still need to look into that...
